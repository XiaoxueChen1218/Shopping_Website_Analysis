# Shopping_Website_Analysis
This is a business intelligence project using SQL to analyse the shopping website conversion funnel and customer behaviours. I find this project on Udemy just after finishing my SQL and A/B Testing courses. It's a very suitable project combining the basic SQL queries and E-commerce domain knowledge for data analysis learner.
